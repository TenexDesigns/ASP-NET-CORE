Creating Pipeline Branches  and Terminal Middleware



The map method is used to create a section of the pipeline that is  used to process requests for specific urls  
creating a separate sequence of middleware  components





this middleware doesnt  invoke the next delegate right here which  makes this middleware terminal 
terminal middleware never forwards requests to other components and always marks the end of  the request pipeline 


and there are two terminal middleware components in our program cs file here  and those are this branch use and also app run  




this run is a convenience feature for  creating terminal middleware so we can change 







using core;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();


((IApplicationBuilder)app).Map("/branch", branch =>
{

  //terminal middleware component number 2 i.e branch.use
    branch.Use(async (HttpContext context, Func<Task> next) =>                            /this middleware doesnt  invoke the next delegate right here which  makes this middleware terminal 
    {

        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Branch middlewwasre");

    }

    );

}

    );




app.UseMiddleware<Middleware>();



app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();                                             /terminal middleware component number 2
                                                   / this run is a convenience feature for  creating terminal middlewar



So in our above code we can remove the next and insted use run on the branch







using core;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();


((IApplicationBuilder)app).Map("/branch", branch =>
{

  //terminal middleware component number 2 i.e branch.use
    branch.Run(async (HttpContext context) =>    //We removed the next and insted used run, so that we dont have to use next.



   {

        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Branch middlewwasre");

    }

    );

}

    );




app.UseMiddleware<Middleware>();



app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run(); 






MORE EXPLANATION OF THE CODE ABOVE, PIPLINE BRANCHES AND TERMINAL MIDDLWEWARE
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************


In the code you provided, you are creating a pipeline branch and using terminal middleware. Lets break down the code and understand its components:

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

((IApplicationBuilder)app).Map("/branch", branch =>
{
    branch.Use(async (HttpContext context, Func<Task> next) =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Branch middleware Gacau and Eliud Wambu");
    });
});

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();

1.You create a WebApplication builder and build the app object.
2.You create a pipeline branch using the Map method. This branch will be executed when the request path starts with "/branch".
3.Inside the branch, you define a terminal middleware using the Use method. This middleware writes "Branch middleware Gacau and Eliud Wambu" to the
response and does not call the next middleware in the pipeline. Since this is a terminal middleware, the request processing is stopped at this point.
4.You create a route mapping for the root path ("/") using app.MapGet. This will respond with "Hello World!" when the root path is requested.
5.Finally, you call app.Run() to start the application.
 
To recap, your code creates a pipeline with a branch that executes a terminal middleware when the request path starts with "/branch".
When a request comes in with a path starting with "/branch", the response will be "Branch middleware Gacau and Eliud Wambu".
For other requests, such as the root path ("/"), the response will be "Hello World!".



In your code, you are trying to create a pipeline branch and use terminal middleware. 
Lets understand what these concepts are and how they work in the context of ASP.NET Core.



Pipeline Branches

Pipeline branches are created using the Map, MapWhen, or UseWhen methods. These methods allow you to branch the middleware pipeline based on certain conditions,
such as the request path or the presence of a specific query string parameter.
Branching the pipeline allows you to execute specific middleware components only when certain conditions are met, and helps in organizing the applications logic 



Terminal Middleware

A terminal middleware is a middleware component that does not call the next middleware in the pipeline.
It is responsible for generating the final response and ending the request processing.
Terminal middleware is usually placed at the end of the pipeline or in a branch that needs to short-circuit the pipeline

Creating Terminal Middleware
___________________________________________________---------------------------
To create a terminal middleware in ASP.NET Core 6, you can use the Run method. 
The Run method adds a terminal component to the app pipeline and does not use the next delegate because 
it is always terminal and terminates the pipeline. This method accepts a single parameter of the RequestDelegate type,
which accepts a single HttpContext parameter code-maze.com.

Heres an example of creating terminal middleware using the Run method:

app.Use(async (HttpContext context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from the middleware component.");
});
Uses and Applications

Terminal middleware has several uses and applications, including:

1.Logging: Terminal middleware can be used to log information about the request and response messages that flow through the pipeline.
2.CORS middleware: Terminal middleware can be used to enforce CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies by
checking the Origin header and allowing or denying the request based on the policy.
3.Exception handling: Terminal middleware can be used to catch and handle exceptions in the request pipeline.
4.Customization: Terminal middleware can be used to customize the way requests and responses are handled,
such as modifying headers, adding custom headers, or transforming the response content infoworld.com.

In conclusion, terminal middleware in ASP.NET Core 6 is a powerful concept that allows you to customize 
the request-response pipeline and handle specific scenarios based on your applications requirements.
















SOMETHING I NOTTED
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************


in the above code, what is this  "Func<Task> next" used for, and what is the diffference btween the above code and
this code which intead uses Run to define a terminal middleware and does not use "Func<Task> next"  , the code is   

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();


((IApplicationBuilder)app).Map("/branch", branch =>
{

    branch.Run(async (HttpContext context) =>
    {

        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Branch middlewwasre Gacau");

    }




    );




}

    THE EXplaNATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------




In the first code snippet you provided, Func<Task> next is a delegate representing the next middleware in the pipeline.
 It is used to pass the control to the next middleware component in the pipeline. When you call await next(), 
you are invoking the next middleware to continue processing the request. 
 If you dont call it, the request processing stops at the current middleware, making it a terminal middleware learn.microsoft.com.

In the second code snippet, you use the Run method instead of the Use method to define the terminal middleware. 
The Run method does not have a Func<Task> next parameter, and it is designed to be terminal middleware.
 When using Run, you dont need to worry about calling the next middleware, because it implicitly short-circuits the pipeline code-maze.com.

HereS the second code snippet for reference:

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

((IApplicationBuilder)app).Map("/branch", branch =>
{
    branch.Run(async (HttpContext context) =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Branch middleware Gacau");
    });
});

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();
                               
In summary, the main difference between the two code snippets is how they define terminal middleware.
The first one uses the Use method with Func<Task> next, which you have to avoid calling to create terminal middleware. 
The second one uses the Run method, which is designed to be terminal middleware by not having a Func<Task> next parameter.
Both approaches achieve the same result: creating a pipeline branch with a terminal middleware that responds with a custom
 message when the request path starts with "/branch".
